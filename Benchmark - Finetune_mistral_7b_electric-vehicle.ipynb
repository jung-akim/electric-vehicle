level\n","updated infotainment system\n","faster onboard charger\n","price: the 2022  i- starts at $69,900.\n","the 2022  i- is an all-electric small luxury suv/crossover with the ability to run for 234 miles between charges. it’s a thrill to drive, has plenty of visual impact, great infotainment tech, and that special  class.\n","when the i- was introduced in 2019, it won many awards — like world car of the year, green car of the year, a couple of design awards, etc. deservedly so.\n","however, the electric vehicle (ev) game has moved on even in the short time between now and 2019. back then, the only tesla alternatives were things like the nissan leaf and chevrolet bolt. but this year sees some interesting ev stuff coming out from audi, kia, and hyundai. tesla also expanded its lineup with the model y. suddenly, the i- is beginning to lose its spark.\n"," chops the range down to one model this year — hse trim. this used to be the top version, costing around $80k. so in effect, buyers are getting the best i- for the price of the erstwhile entry-level model, or a price cut of about $10,000. the company has also upgraded the onboard charger for faster battery replenishment.\n","where is the 2022  i- built? at the magna steyr plant in austria, an independent facility that also makes the mercedes-benz g-class and the bmw z4. anyone familiar with s of old with lingering worries about build quality should be reassured by this information.\n","used 2022  i- pricingused 2022  i- pricing starts at $34,800 for the i- ev400 hse sport utility 4d, which had a starting msrp of $71,175 when new. the range-topping 2022 i- ev400 hse sport utility 4d starts at $34,800 today, originally priced from $71,175.original msrpkbb fair purchase price (nat'l average)ev400 hse sport utility 4d$71,175$34,800the kelley blue book fair purchase price for any individual used vehicle can vary greatly according to mileage, condition, location, and other factors. the prices here reflect what buyers are currently paying for used 2022  i- models in typical condition when purchasing from a dealership. these prices are updated weekly.driving the used 2022  i-how fast is the 2022  i-? it can sprint from standstill to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, which is sports-car quick. that is one of the laudable traits of electric motors: their power comes on almost like flipping a switch, and  has tuned the i- to contain and command that muscle.\n","an adaptive air suspension is also standard, with the ability to raise the ride height for an off-road situation, or lower it automatically for better aerodynamics on the freeway. on twisting roads, the i- is agile and precise. yet it can also be pliable and comfortable.\n","making a special contribution to cornering is the brake-based torque vectoring, where the inside rear wheel is slowed subtly, allowing the i- to track around turns with stability.\n","another special trait of electric vehicles is their brake regeneration system that helps create usable energy. the i- provides selectable levels of regeneration, the most extreme resulting in one-pedal driving — press on the accelerator to go faster, lift to slow down. it’s helpful in the city, but not smooth enough to use on quicker, clearer roads.\n","interior comfortbalancing a substantial amount of tech with the upscale ambience of a luxury vehicle, the i- has an agreeable cabin with quality materials. occupant s is good for four adults.\n","standard trim accents are finished in gloss black, although buyers can choose aluminum, ash, or carbon fiber from the options list. the i- also offers an optional headliner in a suede-like fabric.\n","cargo s is a commodious 25.3 cubic feet behind the 40/20/40 split/folding rear seats. or 51 cubic feet when they’re folded down. there’s also extra storage under the hood, as well as under the rear seats.\n","exterior stylingian callum, former head of ’s design team, considers the i- one of his finest creations. and he was the guy who designed the db7 and vanquish for aston martin.\n","there are similarities, despite the obvious fact that the i- is a small suv/crossover with a short hood. all three have well-judged, elegant proportions and curves that imply muscle. the triumph of the i- is that it does this while still being able to accommodate four adults, or five in a pinch.\n","most electric vehicles have a closed-off section where a grille would normally go. the i- has a grille, but it’s for optimum aerodynamics rather than cooling any combustion engine. air flows in and then out through the large hood vent.\n","fuji white is the only no-cost paint choice. most alternatives cost $750, but there are a couple of $1,550 finishes. buyers may also go for a more stealthy look with window/grille surrounds and side mirror housings in black. or brighten things up with those same pieces finished in chrome.\n","favorite featuresinfotainment system\n","’s older infotainment setup came in for criticism, but this new system is faster and easier to use. the standard navigation feature takes charging stations along the route into account and can calculate what the battery levels will be once the i- reaches each charger. as the charging network expands, the system receives over-the-air updates.\n","standard equipment inventory\n","with trim levels reduced to just the hse, the 2022 i- comes with a lot of standard equipment. we’re especially pleased to see so many driver-assistance features included, and pleased to hear the meridian surround-sound system.\n","standard featuresnow that the 2022 i- comes solely in hse trim, almost everything is included. standard are 20-inch alloy wheels, led headlights/taillights, fixed panoramic roof, heated side mirrors (self-dimming on the driver’s side), keyless entry/start, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, heated/ventilated/16-way power-adjustable front seats, heated rear seats, a powered tailgate, and rain-sensing windshield wipers.\n","the infotainment system has apple carplay/android auto smartphone integration, navigation, satellite radio, five usb ports, and a 17-speaker (including one subwoofer)/825-watt meridian surround-sound system.\n","among the standard driver aids are automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, blind-spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control with steering assistance, automatic high beams, and a head-up display.\n","the battery has an 8-year/100,000-mile warranty.\n","factory optionswe’ll assume buyers will want to spend the extra $210 for the panoramic sunroof’s shade. a cold climate pack adds a heated steering wheel/windshield/washer jets. the park assist pack brings a 360-degree camera system and parking sensors at both ends.\n","other options include wireless charging, wi-fi, clearsight rearview mirror (see the safety technology section below), quad-zone automatic climate control, hands-free tailgate operation, fog lights, and adaptive surface response — a cruise control for tricky surfaces.\n","engine & transmissioneach axle in the 2022 i- has its own electric motor, for a standard all-wheel-drive system. total output is 394 horsepower and 512 lb-ft of torque. that’s a lot, particularly in a small crossover with an aluminum-intensive construction.\n","the previous 7-kw onboard charger has been upgraded to a faster 11-kw unit. so the lithium-ion battery pack can accomplish a full recharge in just under nine hours on a 240-volt supply, as opposed to nearly 13 hours. when using a dc fast charger, the battery can take on enough energy in 15 minutes to achieve a range of up to 63 miles.\n","maximum range on a full charge is 234 miles. the environmental protection agency (epa) has a miles-per-gallon equivalent (mpge) calculation for electric vehicles. the i- is estimated to achieve a combined figure (a mix of city and highway driving) of 76 mpge. the epa estimates here are from 2021, but we expect 2022’s to be the same.\n","two permanent magnet electric motors\n","90-kwh lithium-ion battery pack\n","394 horsepower\n","512 lb-ft of torque\n","estimated range per

of both driving and number crunching to make sure that you choose the best car for you. we comprehensively experience and analyze every new suv, car, truck, or minivan for sale in the u.s. and compare it to its competitors. when all that dust settles, we have our ratings.\n","we require new ratings every time an all-new vehicle or a new generation of an existing vehicle comes out. additionally, we reassess those ratings when a new-generation vehicle receives a mid-cycle refresh — basically, sprucing up a car in the middle of its product cycle (typically, around the 2-3 years mark) with a minor facelift, often with updates to features and technology.\n","rather than pulling random numbers out of the air or off some meaningless checklist, kbb’s editors rank a vehicle to where it belongs in its class. before any car earns its kbb rating, it must prove itself to be better (or worse) than the other cars it’s competing against as it tries to get you to spend your money buying or leasing.\n","our editors drive and live with a given vehicle. we ask all the right questions about the interior, the exterior, the engine and powertrain, the ride and handling, the features, the comfort, and of course, about the price. does it serve the purpose for which it was built? (whether that purpose is commuting efficiently to and from work in the city, keeping your family safe, making you feel like you’ve made it to the top — or that you’re on your way — or making you feel like you’ve finally found just the right partner for your lifestyle.)\n","we take each vehicle we test through the mundane — parking, lane-changing, backing up, cargo s and loading — as well as the

driving and number crunching to make sure that you choose the best car for you. we comprehensively experience and analyze every new suv, car, truck, or minivan for sale in the u.s. and compare it to its competitors. when all that dust settles, we have our ratings.\n","we require new ratings every time an all-new vehicle or a new generation of an existing vehicle comes out. additionally, we reassess those ratings when a new-generation vehicle receives a mid-cycle refresh — basically, sprucing up a car in the middle of its product cycle (typically, around the 2-3 years mark) with a minor facelift, often with updates to features and technology.\n","rather than pulling random numbers out of the air or off some meaningless checklist, kbb’s editors rank a vehicle to where it belongs in its class. before any car earns its kbb rating, it must prove itself to be better (or worse) than the other cars it’s competing against as it tries to get you to spend your money buying or leasing.\n","our editors drive and live with a given vehicle. we ask all the right questions about the interior, the exterior, the engine and powertrain, the ride and handling, the features, the comfort, and of course, about the price. does it serve the purpose for which it was built? (whether that purpose is commuting efficiently to and from work in the city, keeping your family safe, making you feel like you’ve made it to the top — or that you’re on your way — or making you feel like you’ve finally found just the right partner for your lifestyle.)\n","we take each vehicle we test through the mundane — parking, lane-changing, backing up, cargo space and loading — as well as the essential — acceleration, braking, handling, interior quiet and comfort, build quality, materials quality, reliability.more about how we rate vehiclesread full

materials, power-adjustable front seats with lumbar support, 3- or 4-zone climate control, and premium audio. musical chimes and warnings inside the cabin arise compliments of the detroit symphony orchestra and inspire auditory delight.\n","seats are highly adjustable and comfortable and there’s plenty of room inside the cabin, even for taller passengers. the third row offers room for adult legs when the second row is fully forward.\n","exterior stylingthe exterior design language of the new  reads understated and classy. the  isn’t overwrought with excessive creases in the sheet metal or character lines attempting to convey perceived power. it’s stance on the standard 19-inch wheels has presence without being overly showy or flashy. even with 21- or 22-inch wheels, the  declares its rightful place in the luxury suv world with restraint. its colors such as iced mocha metallic, burgundy velvet metallic, and infinite black metallic present a sophisticated visage.\n","favorite featuresinterior appointment\n"," has stepped up its game as of late in the luxury-cabin department. from the fit and finish, seat comfort, customizable tech, optional black label design packages, as well as an extraordinary revel sound system available, there is little left wanting once you slide into the ’s interior.\n","phone as a key\n","no more key fob in your pocket. with phone as a key, your smartphone acts as your key. it can open the doors, start the car (even remotely) and wind down windows. if your phone runs out of charge, no worries, you can unlock your car using the keypad on the door.\n","standard featuresstandard features on the   come aplenty including a 10.1-inch touch screen perched atop the center stack, with physical buttons for climate controls, audio volume and drives modes, among other features, intuitively mingling below it and extending to the generous center console. ambient interior lighting,  connect with wi-fi hotspot capability, rain-sensing wipers, and a power-fold 3rd-row seat also come standard.\n","factory optionson the new  option interior goodies include a 5.8-inch touch screen in the second row for passengers to control temperature and audio volume, as well as heated and ventilated seats when thusly equipped. other features such as wireless charging, quad-zone climate control, panoramic sunroof, 2nd row captain’s chairs, as well as an upgraded 14-speaker revel audio system, are also available.\n","if music is really your jam, the  offers a superb 28-speaker audio system from revel that sounds as good as any professional recording studio. add to that the whisper-quiet cabin, thanks to extensive sound dampening measures used throughout the  even in the tires, and you might even be able to record an album in your suv after dropping the kids off at school.\n","engine & transmissionwith the gas-powered , there is noticeable lag in the twin-turbo v6, and punchier downshifts on that 10-speed would be appreciated, especially in quick acceleration situations, but there are paddle shifters to help the driver facilitate this when needed.\n","on the phev , power feels more immediate and plentiful both off the line and when needing a surge, even at speed. if a buyer is looking for a more performance-forward suv in this segment, then the   grand touring hybrid deserves attention. this phev has an epa-estimated range of 460 miles.\n","twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter v6\n","400 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm\n","415 lb-ft of torque @ 3,000 rpm\n","epa city/highway fuel economy: 18/26 mpg (rwd), 17/24 mpg

choose the best car for you. we comprehensively experience and analyze every new suv, car, truck, or minivan for sale in the u.s. and compare it to its competitors. when all that dust settles, we have our ratings.\n","we require new ratings every time an all-new vehicle or a new generation of an existing vehicle comes out. additionally, we reassess those ratings when a new-generation vehicle receives a mid-cycle refresh — basically, sprucing up a car in the middle of its product cycle (typically, around the 2-3 years mark) with a minor facelift, often with updates to features and technology.\n","rather than pulling random numbers out of the air or off some meaningless checklist, kbb’s editors rank a vehicle to where it belongs in its class. before any car earns its kbb rating, it must prove itself to be better (or worse) than the other cars it’s competing against as it tries to get you to spend your money buying or leasing.\n","our editors drive and live with a given vehicle. we ask all the right questions about the interior, the exterior, the engine and powertrain, the ride and handling, the features, the comfort, and of course, about the price. does it serve the purpose for which it was built? (whether that purpose is commuting efficiently to and from work in the city, keeping your family safe, making you feel like you’ve made it to the top — or that you’re on your way — or making you feel like you’ve finally found just the right partner for your lifestyle.)\n","we take each vehicle we test through the mundane — parking, lane-changing, backing up, cargo space and loading — as well as the essential — acceleration, braking, handling, interior quiet and comfort, build quality, materials quality, reliability.more about how we rate vehiclesread full

sale\\nover-the-air updates include a snow mode\\nthe 2023   is an all-electric pickup truck with a maximum range of 400 miles, real driving talents on the tarmac and off, plus a lot of standard equipment. pricing starts at $73,000.\\n is still a new company. the  truck launched only in 2021 and its r1s all-electric 7-seater suv made its debut in 2022. but the world of electric vehicles is not so set in its ways as the old-school combustion companies.\\nso a  could be just as appealing as a tesla or a lucid. this operation \\u2014 based in irvine, california, yet with a production facility in normal, illinois \\u2014 has actually beaten tesla to the punch by creating the  and bringing it to market before the almost-mythical cybertruck, whose production keeps being delayed.\\nthe  can also stand wheel-to-wheel with rivals like the ford f-150 lightning and gmc hummer ev pickup. buyers wanting to look beyond the established marques for some fresh thinking will find they have a few interesting choices, the  being one of them.\\n2023   pricingthe 2023   starts at $73,000. that\\u2019s the manufacturer\\u2019s suggested retail price (msrp) for the adventure version with two motors and all-wheel drive, and doesn\\u2019t include the $1,800 factory-to-dealer delivery fee (destination charge). the performance dual-motor model begins at $84,000.\\n also offers a quad-motor variant starting at $87,000. the larger battery pack is $6,000, or the max pack (not available with the quad-motor model) is $16,000. taking the quad-motor and adding a bunch of options will push the final price a little past $100k.\\nthe electric pickup class is still in its infancy, but there are already some intriguing contenders. the ford f-150 lightning, for example, starts at $56k \\u2014 albeit quite a sparse model at that price. the new gmc hummer ev pickup starts at $109k. and the tesla cybertruck is supposed to be coming for 2023, but we shouldn\\u2019t hold our breath.\\n2023  \\n\",\n          \"pros\\n324-mile range\\nfast charging\\nsustainable manufacturing\\ncons\\npricey\\nwhat's new?\\nhigh-performance  m60\\nnew options packages\\ngesture control revised\\nmade in an eco-friendly factory, the 2023   all-electric luxury midsize suv can be a great choice for those whose plentiful finances are equaled by the desire for responsible personal transport. pricing starts at $84,100.\\nthe   is now officially a range. last year, the lineup was just one model, the xdrive50. this year sees the addition of the 2023  m60.\\nthis is significant. for  to make an m version of what is still a new vehicle without an established track record (so to speak; the  debuted only last year) shows the company\\u2019s commitment to electric vehicles while retaining the talents for which  cars \\u2014 especially versions from the high-performance m division \\u2014 are quite rightly praised.\\nanother aspect of all this is how battery technology is now at the level where it can be a convincing method of propulsion for luxury cars and sporty cars alike. ranges are great enough to dispel anxiety, charging times are quick enough to be practical. the lithium-ion battery in the  has an 8-year/100,000-mile warranty.\\nspeaking of lithium, and cobalt, aluminum, carbon fiber reinforced plastic, and all the other particular elements that go into making a modern electric vehicle,  is taking steps to ensure they are all sourced responsibly and sustainably \\u2014 with transparency and respecting human rights.\\n2023   pricingthe 2023   has a starting sticker price of $85,095, with the range-topping  m60 kicking off at $109,895. but kelley blue book fair purchase pricing currently suggests paying $7,472 to $10,605 less than msrp, depending on trim and equipment. these prices are updated weekly.msrpkbb fair purchase price (nat'l average)xdrive50$85,095$77,623m60$109,895$99,290driving the 2023  smartphone recognition means never having to dig around in pockets or purses for the car keys to open and start the 2023 . for all the technology that comes in the , it\\u2019s still user-friendly. it will automatically select each driver\\u2019s preferred radio station as well.\\nelectric motors generate exceptional torque and the  tackles uphill stretches as if they didn\\u2019t exist. a pair of them provides all-wheel drive, with the rear motor handling a larger share of the work in normal conditions, creating a sporty feel and maximizing efficiency.\\nin the xdrive 50, the sprint from standstill to 60 mph happens in a brief 4.6 seconds. naturally, the more powerful  m60 is quicker: 3.6 seconds.\\nthe  feels stable regardless of speed, and remains composed through corners, even though the suspension is tuned primarily for comfort. the  m60 also has an air suspension as standard, bringing smoothness as well as the kind of precise handling that comes with an m model.\\nthe brake pedal can feel a little too eager initially, but the overall action is acceptable and something the driver can get used to quite quickly.\\none facet that has a small learning curve is one-pedal driving. there are three levels of brake energy regeneration, so easing off the throttle slows the vehicle down more than it would in a conventional car with a combustion engine. in the stop/go mayhem of city traffic, this can be a distinct advantage. the right foot rarely has to jump over to the brake pedal and then back again.\\nwe\\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours driving and researching the current collection of luxury electric suvs.\\nsmart interiordespite the use of recycled materials \\u2014 like nylon waste and old fishing nets \\u2014 the cabin of the 2023  looks and feels as premium as anyone spending the best part of $100k on a vehicle would want.\\nthere\\u2019s a suitably high-tech atmosphere as well. the 12.3-inch driver information display is incorporated into a larger curved unit (covered with glare-resistant glass) that also accommodates a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen. this is complemented by a hexagonal steering wheel.\\nadult passengers in the back shouldn\\u2019t find much to complain about with 38.9 inches of legroom. behind the 40/20/40 split/folding rear seats is an expansive luggage area of 35.5 cubic feet. with those seats folded, cargo volume maxes out at 77.9 cubic feet.\\nsome electric cars have an extra storage space under the hood, but  doesn\\u2019t want customers rummaging around there. adding windshield wiper fluid is done by flipping up the  badge.\\nintelligent exteriorsize-wise, the 2023  is similar to the ever-popular x5. the closer we get to the , though, the more the differences stand out. we might as well talk about the grille first, since it\\u2019s hard to miss.\\nfirstly, an electric vehicle doesn\\u2019t really need a grille. but it\\u2019s a  hallmark, so it\\u2019s part of the  package, repurposed as an \\u201cintelligence panel\\u201d containing sensors for the driver assistance and advanced safety features. the rear  badge does something similar, housing the rearview camera. the door handles are flush to the body for optimum aerodynamics, and the headlights are much smaller than an x5\\u2019s.\\non the subject of aerodynamics, the  has an extremely low drag coefficient of 0.25. this also helps to keep wind noise low.\\nthe new  m60 has a roof made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (cfrp) to shave off a little weight and lower the center of gravity even more. and the brake calipers are painted that special shade of m blue.\\nour favorite features and techsustainability\\n\\u2019s ambition is to build electric vehicles cleaner and greener than the competition. this includes responsible sourcing of rare elements like cobalt and lithium for the batteries, fitting recycled materials into the cabins, using solar power to make aluminum components, and hydro-electric power for specialized manufacturing plants.\\ninfotainment system\\nmost people familiar with \\u2019s infotainment system know that it\\u2019s called idrive. now in its eighth iteration, it has evolved to become wonderfully user-friendly and able to incorporate the specific needs of electric vehicles. in the new  , it comes with a curved 14.9-inch touchscreen, over-the-air updates, advanced voice recognition, and dedicated user profiles.\\nrapid charging\\nbeing able to add 90 miles of range in 10 minutes (using a dc fast charger) is impressive. just answer a couple of emails and it\\u2019s time to hit the road again.\\nhead-up display with augmented reality\\noptional in the xdrive50, standard in the m60, this head-up display uses augmented reality to superimpose things like arrows onto the road, making navigation information clearer.\\nadaptive led headlights with laserlight\\nadaptive headlights follow the direction of the steering. they can also change the shape of the illumination area, so as not to dazzle other road users. the laser tech is more powerful than leds, yet require even less energy \\u2014 an important consideration for an electric vehicle. these are standard in the m60.\\nbowers & wilkins surround-sound system\\nexclusive to the m60, this 30-speaker/1,615-watt arrangement is an absolute treat for the ears.\\nbattery power, charge times, and rangein the regular 2023  xdrive50, 516 horsepower and 564 lb-ft of torque is developed by twin electric motors. they\\u2019re constructed in such a way that no rare earth metals are required for any magnetic components.\\nwith one motor driving each axle, the  xdrive50 and the  m60 have an electronic version of all-wheel drive as standard.\\nthe new-for-2023  m60 develops 610 horsepower and a mighty 811 lb-ft of torque, achieving maximum output in sport mode and with launch control engaged. most of the time, a still-impressive 532 horsepower and 749 lb-ft of torque are simmering away under the hood.\\nboth vehicles have liquid-cooled lithium-ion batteries mounted under the floor. using a dc fast charger, replenishment from a 10% capacity to 80% can take as little as 35 minutes. or 90 miles of range can be transmitted in 10 minutes.\\nrecharging from a domestic outlet takes considerably longer. an 11-kilowatt home setup achieves a full charge in 10.25 hours.\\nthese energy consumption figures from the environmental protection agency (epa) might seem a little odd at first, since larger wheels usually mean shorter ranges. but the differences between all-weather tires and

wanting a car that could corner, accelerate, and brake like a sports car but needed the convenience of four doors had to turn to a car like the  3 series. crossover suvs have challenged that notion, and the   is arguably one of the best examples. even with its added ground clearance, the  is among the sportiest of sport utility vehicles.\\neven in base form, the  offers plenty of horsepower for quick acceleration. the \\u2019s inherent rear-wheel-drive layout and well-sorted suspension allow it to round corners like a low-slung sedan while simultaneously offering enough ground clearance for light off-roading. the rear-wheel-drive  sdrive30i and all-wheel-drive xdrive30i can dash to 60 mph in 6 seconds \\u2014 pretty quick for a small suv. move up to the 6-cylinder  m40i, and that time drops to 4.4 seconds. the high-performance (and high-priced)  m can hit that benchmark in as little as 4 seconds. that\\u2019s just a tick behind the other little monsters in this class, the v8-powered mercedes-amg glc and alfa romeo stelvio quadrifoglio.\\nas we noted, the  has a rear-wheel-drive (rwd) bias, whereas most of its rivals are front-wheel-drive or front-biased. the \\u2019s rwd setup allows the front wheels to focus on steering as opposed to also powering the vehicle, which, as every driving enthusiast knows, is the preferred setup when speeding through tight turns. a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic includes paddle shifters for manual gear changes, while \\u2019s driving dynamics control allows the driver to tailor vehicle settings to his or her likings.\\nduring our time with the system, we found the sport+ mode made the steering too heavy. by playing with the customizable settings, we were able to tone down the steering feel while boosting settings for the engine and throttle response, in essence creating our own unique .\\ninterior comfort\\u2019s  has the same design aesthetic as other recent vehicles from the german luxury brand. there\\u2019s a wide-view display mounted high on the dash, the idrive control knob alongside \\u2019s unique gear selector, and the same ergonomics of the  ownership experience for the past couple of decades. it leans more toward the minimalistic end, but there\\u2019s a built-in premium feel to its simplicity. controls for common functions like audio and climate are logical and easy to reach, but the idrive circular controller for screen functions and even the pistol-like gearshift take some getting used to. we recommend getting familiar with both during your test drive.\\ninterior tech includes a standard 8.8-inch touchscreen or optional 10.25-inch display. one really nice touch is the optional all-digital instrument panel that replaces the analog gauges with a fully configurable 12.3-inch screen, similar to audi\\u2019s virtual cockpit.\\nas we highlighted in favorite features, the  is roomy inside, even for its compact class. the driver and front passenger have plenty of space, and most rear-seat passengers will find good legroom. headroom is similarly plentiful, and the cargo space is near the top of the class in both usability and outright space. in addition to a flat-floor cargo area, there\\u2019s room for small items should you want to hide them beneath the floor. the new  plug-in hybrid xdrive30e doesn\\u2019t sacrifice much space even with its battery pack under the rear seats. it has only 1.5 cubic feet less space than the standard model.\\nexterior stylingif it seems even small cars today are bigger, it\\u2019s not your imagination. this latest, third-generation  is actually slightly larger than the first-generation  x5, which is technically a size bigger. but the  wears its volume well and doesn\\u2019t look oversized. the optional 20- or 21-inch wheels look great, and the wide stance imparts a sense of stability.\\nwe think the overall integration of headlights, grille, and other elements feels more cohesive on this model than that of the previous generation. the same is true in the back, where the taillights flow cleanly into the tailgate. the  m40i wears more aggressive sheet metal, with deeper front and rear bumpers, body-color side-sill extensions, and more aggressive wheel-and-tire combinations. the  m sits lower to the ground, rolls on 21-inch wheels and tires, and boasts quad exhaust outlets.\\nfavorite featuresandroid auto integration\\nthis is more a \\u201cfinally!\\u201d than a \\u201cfavorite,\\u201d but it\\u2019s worth highlighting nonetheless. while s have long integrated apple carplay, that hasn\\u2019t been the case with rival android smartphones. that changes with the 2021 model year, with s finally getting android auto, too.\\nspace management\\nlittle on the outside doesn\\u2019t always mean little on the inside, too. the  provides good legroom both front and rear, and even better headroom stats. the \\u2019s cargo hold measures 28.7 cubic feet, which is more than the audi q5 but less than the infiniti qx50. a triple-split/folding rear seat allows 2-passenger seating while the center section can be folded to accommodate long items like skis or 2x4s.\\nstandard featuresthe 2021   comes in five main forms: sdrive30i, xdrive30i, m40i, xdrive30e, and the high-performance  m.\\nout the gate, the 2021   sdrive30i comes nicely equipped with a power tailgate, 3-zone automatic climate control, 10-way-power front seats, sensatec faux-leather upholstery, rain-sensing windshield wipers, universal garage-door opener, and standard parking sensors.\\nthe standard idrive infotainment system bundles an 8.8-inch screen that can be controlled by touch or the idrive dial, navigation, and a 12-speaker/205-watt am/fm/hd radio with usb input and bluetooth streaming. apple carplay and android auto are standard. for 2021, siriusxm satellite radio with a one-year trial is included.\\nstandard active safety features include frontal-collision warning and the automatic city collision mitigation braking system, which can automatically apply the brakes if the vehicle senses an impending crash. now standard for 2021 is the formerly optional active driving assistant package with lane-departure warning, pedestrian detection, and blind-spot monitoring.\\nnew s also include ultimate care, which covers three years/36,000 miles of complimentary maintenance.\\nfactory optionsthe  xdrive30i adds all-wheel drive ( calls it \\u201cxdrive\\u201d), and like the sdrive30i model offers three jumping-off points: xline, luxury and m sport. the luxury line, for example, adds chrome trim, while the m sport gives the standard model sporty-looking flair.\\nwhile there are plenty of stand-alone options,  has grouped many of them into \\u201ctiers.\\u201d the convenience tier adds amenities like lumbar support, keyless entry, and a panoramic sunroof. premium adds the sweet 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a head-up display, heated front/rear seats, and heated steering wheel. the executive tier includes adaptive full led headlights, parking assistant, surround view with 3d view, and \\u2019s rather finicky gesture control.\\nbesides a more powerful engine and other performance gear, the m40i takes a different approach, offering many of those features as stand-alone option packages. note that both models offer leather as an option, not standard. other options include the driver assistance plus package that bundles adaptive cruise control, active lane-keeping assist, and other active-safety features, while the dynamic handling package features dynamic damper control, m sport brake and variable sport steering. also in the offering are a premium harman/kardon audio system, wireless phone charger, and wi-fi hotspot.\\nthe high-performance  m includes a 473-horsepower turbocharged 6-cylinder engine and upgraded hardware to back up its extra power. that includes performance brakes, differential, and transmission. the  m rolls on standard 20-inch wheels with performance tires and includes upgraded amenities like leather interior, harman kardon audio system, and a hands-free liftgate. even this model can be spruced up. the $7,000 competition package adds 30 horsepower, 21-inch wheels, blacked-out aesthetics, sport exhaust, and more.\\nengine & transmissionyou get a choice of four powertrains in the 2021   lineup. at the entry-level, the sdrive30i and all-wheel-drive xdrive30i are powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder developing 248 horsepower. this engine exists throughout the  lineup and has proven itself as reliable as it is fuel-efficient.\\nmoving up to the  m40i brings two more cylinders in the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6, as well as standard xdrive all-wheel drive. with 355 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, this engine never feels taxed or labored, even with four persons aboard. fuel economy does go down by a few mpg, but is still acceptable for an engine of this size and output.\\nthe xdrive30e is the first plug-in hybrid version of the . it pairs a turbocharged 2.0-liter and battery-fed electric motor to produce a total of 288 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque.  says the xdrive30e does 0-60 mph in 5.9 seconds. moreover, it\\u2019s also very efficient, earning up to 60 miles per gallon equivalent (mpge). the xdrive30e can travel up to 18 miles on electricity alone. in hybrid mode, it goes up to 68 mph on electric power alone, and up to 84 mph in electric mode. on a level 2 charger, the plug-in  can be recharged in approximately 3 hours.\\nfor the power-hungry, the  m uses a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 to make a ridiculous 473 horsepower or 503 horsepower in the  m competition.\\nall models have an 8-speed automatic transmission. also onboard is the fuel-saving start/stop system that can be somewhat annoying as it\\u2019s far from seamless. the system can be deactivated, but the driver must do so every time the car is started, as with most other systems of

factory, the 2023   all-electric luxury midsize suv can be a great choice for those whose plentiful finances are equaled by the desire for responsible personal transport. pricing starts at $84,100.\\nthe   is now officially a range. last year, the lineup was just one model, the xdrive50. this year sees the addition of the 2023  m60.\\nthis is significant. for  to make an m version of what is still a new vehicle without an established track record (so to speak; the  debuted only last year) shows the company\\u2019s commitment to electric vehicles while retaining the talents for which  cars \\u2014 especially versions from the high-performance m division \\u2014 are quite rightly praised.\\nanother aspect of all this is how battery technology is now at the level where it can be a convincing method of propulsion for luxury cars and sporty cars alike. ranges are great enough to dispel anxiety, charging times are quick enough to be practical. the lithium-ion battery in the  has an 8-year/100,000-mile warranty.\\nspeaking of lithium, and cobalt, aluminum, carbon fiber reinforced plastic, and all the other particular elements that go into making a modern electric vehicle,  is taking steps to ensure they are all sourced responsibly and sustainably \\u2014 with transparency and respecting human rights.\\n2023   pricingthe 2023   has a starting sticker price of $85,095, with the range-topping  m60 kicking off at $109,895. but kelley blue book fair purchase pricing currently suggests paying $7,472 to $10,605 less than msrp, depending on trim and equipment. these prices are updated weekly.msrpkbb fair purchase price (nat'l average)xdrive50$85,095$77,623m60$109,895$99,290driving the 2023  smartphone recognition means never having to dig around in pockets or purses for the car keys to open and start the 2023 . for all the technology that comes in the , it\\u2019s still user-friendly. it will automatically select each driver\\u2019s preferred radio station as well.\\nelectric motors generate exceptional torque and the  tackles uphill stretches as if they didn\\u2019t exist. a pair of them provides all-wheel drive, with the rear motor handling a larger share of the work in normal conditions, creating a sporty feel and maximizing efficiency.\\nin the xdrive 50, the sprint from standstill to 60 mph happens in a brief 4.6 seconds. naturally, the more powerful  m60 is quicker: 3.6 seconds.\\nthe  feels stable regardless of speed, and remains composed through corners, even though the suspension is tuned primarily for comfort. the  m60 also has an air suspension as standard, bringing smoothness as well as the kind of precise handling that comes with an m model.\\nthe brake pedal can feel a little too eager initially, but the overall action is acceptable and something the driver can get used to quite quickly.\\none facet that has a small learning curve is one-pedal driving. there are three levels of brake energy regeneration, so easing off the throttle slows the vehicle down more than it would in a conventional car with a combustion engine. in the stop/go mayhem of city traffic, this can be a distinct advantage. the right foot rarely has to jump over to the brake pedal and then back again.\\nwe\\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours driving and researching the current collection of luxury electric suvs.\\nsmart interiordespite the use of recycled materials \\u2014 like nylon waste and old fishing nets \\u2014 the cabin of the 2023  looks and feels as premium as anyone spending the best part of $100k on a vehicle would want.\\nthere\\u2019s a suitably high-tech atmosphere as well. the 12.3-inch driver information display is incorporated into a larger curved unit (covered with glare-resistant glass) that also accommodates a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen. this is complemented by a hexagonal steering wheel.\\nadult passengers in the back shouldn\\u2019t find much to complain about with 38.9 inches of legroom. behind the 40/20/40 split/folding rear seats is an expansive luggage area of 35.5 cubic feet. with those seats folded, cargo volume maxes out at 77.9 cubic feet.\\nsome electric cars have an extra storage space under the hood, but  doesn\\u2019t want customers rummaging around there. adding windshield wiper fluid is done by flipping up the  badge.\\nintelligent exteriorsize-wise, the 2023  is similar to the ever-popular x5. the closer we get to the , though, the more the differences stand out. we might as well talk about the grille first, since it\\u2019s hard to miss.\\nfirstly, an electric vehicle doesn\\u2019t really need a grille. but it\\u2019s a  hallmark, so it\\u2019s part of the  package, repurposed as an \\u201cintelligence panel\\u201d containing sensors for the driver assistance and advanced safety features. the rear  badge does something similar, housing the rearview camera. the door handles are flush to the body for optimum aerodynamics, and the headlights are much smaller than an x5\\u2019s.\\non the subject of aerodynamics, the  has an extremely low drag coefficient of 0.25. this also helps to keep wind noise low.\\nthe new  m60 has a roof made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (cfrp) to shave off a little weight and lower the center of gravity even more. and the brake calipers are painted that special shade of m blue.\\nour favorite features and techsustainability\\n\\u2019s ambition is to build electric vehicles cleaner and greener than the competition. this includes responsible sourcing of rare elements like cobalt and lithium for the batteries, fitting recycled materials into the cabins, using solar power to make aluminum components, and hydro-electric power for specialized manufacturing plants.\\ninfotainment system\\nmost people familiar with \\u2019s infotainment system know that it\\u2019s called idrive. now in its eighth iteration, it has evolved to become wonderfully user-friendly and able to incorporate the specific needs of electric vehicles. in the new  , it comes with a curved 14.9-inch touchscreen, over-the-air updates, advanced voice recognition, and dedicated user profiles.\\nrapid charging\\nbeing able to add 90 miles of range in 10 minutes (using a dc fast charger) is impressive. just answer a couple of emails and it\\u2019s time to hit the road again.\\nhead-up display with augmented reality\\noptional in the xdrive50, standard in the m60, this head-up display uses augmented reality to superimpose things like arrows onto the road, making navigation information clearer.\\nadaptive led headlights with laserlight\\nadaptive headlights follow the direction of the steering. they can also change the shape of the illumination area, so as not to dazzle other road users. the laser tech is more powerful than leds, yet require even less energy \\u2014 an important consideration for an electric vehicle. these are standard in the m60.\\nbowers & wilkins surround-sound system\\nexclusive to the m60, this 30-speaker/1,615-watt arrangement is an absolute treat for the ears.\\nbattery power, charge times, and rangein the regular 2023  xdrive50, 516 horsepower and 564 lb-ft of torque is developed by twin electric motors. they\\u2019re constructed in such a way that no rare earth metals are required for any magnetic components.\\nwith one motor driving each axle, the  xdrive50 and the  m60 have an electronic version of all-wheel drive as standard.\\nthe new-for-2023  m60 develops 610 horsepower and a mighty 811 lb-ft of torque, achieving maximum output in sport mode and with launch control engaged. most of the time, a still-impressive 532 horsepower and 749 lb-ft of torque are simmering away under the hood.\\nboth vehicles have liquid-cooled lithium-ion batteries mounted under the floor. using a dc fast charger, replenishment from a 10% capacity to 80% can take as little as 35 minutes. or 90 miles of range can be transmitted in 10 minutes.\\nrecharging from a domestic outlet takes considerably longer. an 11-kilowatt home setup achieves a full charge in 10.25 hours.\\nthese energy consumption figures from the environmental protection agency (epa) might seem a little odd at first, since larger wheels usually mean shorter ranges. but the differences between all-weather tires and performance tires throw an extra factor into the calculations.\\n2023   xdrive50\\n516

tachometer. leather covers the steering wheel and gear lever on all models.\\nthe  center stack is dominated by a large touch screen, mounted in a vertical fashion, a la tesla. with its multiple menus and controls, this sensus system helps to de-clutter the interior and provide a welcome scandinavian ambience, but it does require  drivers to take their eyes off the road a bit too often. on a positive note, the  seats are all-day comfortable, even with the large side bolsters that provide excellent cornering support. a large cargo area with a flat floor is found behind the rear bench,

expert ratings come from hours of both driving and number crunching to make sure that you choose the best car for you. we comprehensively experience and analyze every new suv, car, truck, or minivan for sale in the u.s. and compare it to its competitors. when all that dust settles, we have our ratings.\\nwe require new ratings every time an all-new vehicle or a new generation of an existing vehicle comes out. additionally, we reassess those ratings when a new-generation vehicle receives a mid-cycle refresh \\u2014 basically, sprucing up a car in the middle of its product cycle (typically, around the 2-3 years mark) with a minor facelift, often with updates to features and technology.\\nrather than pulling random numbers out of the air or off some meaningless checklist, kbb\\u2019s editors rank a vehicle to where it belongs in its class. before any car earns its kbb rating, it must prove itself to be better (or worse) than the other cars it\\u2019s competing against as it tries to get you to spend your money buying or leasing.\\nour editors drive and live with a given vehicle. we ask all the right questions about the interior, the exterior, the engine and powertrain, the ride and handling, the features, the comfort, and of course, about the price. does it serve the purpose for which it was built?

midsize luxury sedan makes its debut, along with the rest of a new 5 series generation. maximum range is a claimed 295 miles. pricing starts at $66,800.\\njust like the i7 is an all-electric version of the 7 series, the new  is a battery-powered 5 series. the entire 5 series undergoes a transformation for this model year, with updated construction and fresh tech features. and although  vehicles tend to be among the costliest in their respective classes, the built-in-germany  is priced competitively.\\nfactor in a decent (yet not class-leading) range, along with the kind of exciting driving experience for which  is renowned, and we reckon the new  already looks like an intriguing contender. there are two  variants initially, the edrive40 and the top m60.\\nthe gasoline-powered new  5 series lineup is reviewed separately.\\nwe\\u2019ve logged hundreds of hours driving and evaluating this generation of electric luxury cars, including the  .\\nwhat's new for 2024the  is an all-new, all-electric midsize luxury sedan. it\\u2019s the battery-powered version of the 5 series, a new generation of which also debuts for 2024. the  m60 is the most powerful version of the new 5 series so far.\\n2024   pricingthe 2024   has a starting sticker price of $67,795, with the range-topping  m60 kicking off at $85,095. but kelley blue book fair purchase pricing currently suggests paying $5,573 to $5,830 less than msrp, depending on trim and equipment. these prices are updated weekly.msrpkbb fair purchase price (nat'l average)edrive40$67,795$62,222m60$85,095$79,265the genesis electrified g80 kicks off in the low $80k range. the mercedes-eq eqe sedan begins in the mid-$70k range. an audi a6 e-tron is also in the works. a fully loaded  m60 will overlap in price with the tesla model s, lucid air, and porsche taycan, all starting in the high $80k territory.\\nbefore buying a new  electric midsize luxury sedan, check the kelley blue book fair purchase price to know what you should be paying.\\npower, ride and handlingthe new  edrive40 employs one electric motor, driving the rear wheels with 335 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. the sprint from standstill to 60 mph happens in just 5.7 seconds.\\nat the top of the new 5 series lineup stands the  m60, with two electric motors, all-wheel drive, plus a considerable 590 horsepower and 586 lb-ft of torque. the m60 hits 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, which is fabulously fast.\\nan adaptive suspension is also standard in the m60 (optional in the edrive40), for a wider spectrum of comfort and sport settings. not that we\\u2019ve ever had issues with any other generation of 5 series. these cars have been delivering an impressive blend of poise and pliancy for years. even the famed  50:50 weight distribution (for a great, balanced feel) makes it into the .\\nin addition, the  m60 has rear-wheel steering (which  calls integral active steering) helping the car track through fast corners in a spectacular manner. that said, this doesn\\u2019t feel exactly like the kind of m car we\\u2019ve grown to know and love. the steering turns the front wheels, but there\\u2019s no sensation of a real connection. the wheel also feels slightly too thick for our tastes. while we\\u2019re on this negative trail, the front sport seats didn\\u2019t feel that comfortable to us. but we\\u2019re prepared to give  the benefit of the doubt because they might prove to be supportive over a longer drive.\\noverall, though, the  is smooth, silent and fast. it also has some smart technology to help the driver, like keeping a safe distance to the vehicle in front even when adaptive cruise control isn\\u2019t activated. while in the driver\\u2019s seat, we felt the cooling system switch itself on automatically after a while. and all it takes is a voice command to perform various functions. we said, \\u201chey, , activate massaging for the driver\\u2019s seat\\u201d and it happened straight away. we looked for steering-wheel paddles to change levels of brake regeneration, but just found a boost paddle instead, so that was a different kind of fun.\\nclassy interiorveganza is not some promotion at whole foods, but the name of a vegan-friendly simulated (and perforated) leather used on the seats, door panels, and even the steering wheel. the real stuff is available as an option.\\nthe new  doesn\\u2019t have conventional air vents, either.  calls them seam vents and they\\u2019re extremely low-profile, in a line going across the dash. overall, the \\u2019s cabin has high-quality materials and a restrained design that adds to the classiness. it also offers typical  extras like glass controls (which may not be everyone\\u2019s idea of tasteful), a panoramic sky lounge roof, and powered shades for the rear windows.\\nsitting up front, we really like the cushioned areas right where we\\u2019d rest our elbows. and rear passenger space is absolutely fine for an adult male of average size.\\ntrunk space is 17.3 cubic feet, a little less than the 18.4 cubic feet in the combustion-powered 5 series (because of the \\u2019s battery), but generous nonetheless. the rear seats can also split and fold in 40/20/40 fashion.\\nevolved exterior has its distinct design language, which could be an acquired taste for some. but we think the looks of the new  and the 5 series in general aren\\u2019t so polarizing that they would be deal-breakers. considering how adventurous  has been with other vehicles, there\\u2019s something pleasantly conventional about this car \\u2014 like it\\u2019s an evolution of previous generations. there are 13 paint choices, including a couple of special frozen finishes. and one option to add a bit of glitz is an illuminated grille.\\nour favorite features and tech curved display\\nevery new  comes with this impressive one-piece unit housing both a digital instrument cluster and the infotainment touchscreen.\\nautomatic park assistant\\nthis standard self-parking feature works for both perpendicular and parallel spaces.\\ninteraction bar\\nspanning the width of the dashboard, this standard feature has touch-control functions for the front passenger as well as the ability to blend in with the cabin\\u2019s multicolored ambient lighting.\\nairconsole\\nthis is a video gaming platform offered for the first time, with 15 titles available. players use their phones as controllers. it\\u2019s one way of passing the time while the  recharges its battery.\\nbowers & wilkins surround-sound system\\noptional in the edrive40, standard in the m60, we\\u2019re big fans of b&w audio systems for their clarity and power.\\ndriving assistance professional package\\noptional in both 2024  variants, but we think it\\u2019s worth the investment. this bundle includes a new highway assistant for hands-free (but not eyes-free) driving, plus evasive steering assistance, active lane-changing assistance, side collision protection, and front cross-traffic warning.\\nbattery, range, and charging says the 2024  edrive40 has a range of 295 miles. that\\u2019s good, even if it\\u2019s not breaking any boundaries. likewise with the 256-mile range of the  m60. both cars beat the porsche taycan\\u2019s best (246 miles), while comparing well with the genesis electrified g80 (282 miles) and looking fairly respectable against the mercedes-eq eqe sedan (305 miles).\\nanother important aspect is how fast an electric car can charge. the metric here is taking the battery from 10% capacity to 80% using a dc fast charger.  says the  can perform this task in 30 minutes. a genesis electrified g80 can be eight minutes down the road when an  driver unhooks the charging cable. but this is still acceptable in the present state of electric vehicle (ev) technology.\\na high-voltage (400 volts) lithium-ion battery supplies the spark for the new . usable energy works out to 84.3 kilowatt-hours (kwh). the battery fits under the floor, so there\\u2019s the same amount of passenger space in every 5 series model, electric or not.\\n\\u2019s electric motors are designed so they don\\u2019t require rare elements like cobalt, that would usually go into magnets. so that\\u2019s another little detail that might work in the \\u2019s favor.\\n4-year/50,000-mile warranty\\n\\u2019s new-vehicle and powertrain warranties both last four years or 50,000 miles, whichever happens first. this is typical among european luxury cars. the lithium-ion battery is covered for eight years or 100,000 miles. there\\u2019s also roadside assistance for the first four years, with unlimited mileage.\\nsafety\\nstandard safety equipment includes forward collision mitigation with left turn warning, active blind spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-keeping assistance.\\nwhat did you think of this review?mediocregoodgreatkbb vehicle review and rating methodologyour expert ratings come from hours of both driving and number crunching to make sure that you choose the best car for you. we comprehensively experience and analyze every new suv, car, truck, or minivan for sale in the u.s. and compare it to its competitors. when all that dust settles, we have our ratings.\\nwe require new ratings every time an all-new vehicle or a new generation of an existing vehicle comes out. additionally, we reassess those ratings when a new-generation vehicle receives a mid-cycle refresh \\u2014 basically, sprucing up a car in the middle of its product cycle (typically, around the 2-3 years mark) with a minor facelift, often with updates to features and technology.\\nrather than pulling random numbers out of the air or off some meaningless checklist, kbb\\u2019s editors rank a vehicle to where it belongs in its class. before any car earns its kbb rating, it must prove itself to be better (or worse) than the other cars it\\u2019s competing against as it tries to get you to spend your money buying or leasing.\\nour editors drive and live with a given vehicle. we ask all the right questions about the interior, the exterior, the engine and powertrain, the ride and handling, the features, the comfort, and of course, about the price. does it serve the purpose for which it was built? (whether that purpose is commuting efficiently to and from work in the city, keeping your family safe, making you feel like you\\u2019ve made it to the top \\u2014 or that you\\u2019re on your way \\u2014 or making you feel like you\\u2019ve finally found just the right partner for your lifestyle.)\\nwe take each vehicle we test through the mundane \\u2014 parking, lane-changing, backing up,

turbocharged and supercharged powerplant that puts out 316 horsepower. merging onto the freeway in the t5 or t6 is a breeze, and the  maintains freeway speeds with an uncanny ease that makes 70 mph seem like about 55.\\nthe t8, with 400 (or 415) horsepower coming from its hybrid gas/electric powertrain, is in another performance league altogether, with a rear-mounted electric motor driving the back wheels. while we appreciate the serious abundance of power, the transitions between gas and electric propulsion aren\\u2019t as smooth as those we felt recently in the new toyota corolla

of the key design elements is a woodgrain ribbon spanning the width of the dash. the instruments are clear, and the panel features a driver-information center between the speedometer and tachometer. leather covers the steering wheel and gear lever on all models.\\nthe  center stack is dominated by a large touch screen, mounted in a vertical fashion, a la tesla. with its multiple menus and controls, this sensus system helps to de-clutter the interior and provide a welcome scandinavian ambience, but it does require  drivers to take their eyes off the road a bit too often. on a positive note, the  seats are all-day comfortable, even with the large side bolsters that provide excellent cornering support. a large cargo area with a flat floor is found behind the rear bench, which is suitable for three.\\nexterior stylingthe  also looks a lot like the xc90 on the outside, which is a good thing because the xc90 ranks high on our list of most attractive suvs. somehow, the  manages to simultaneously look aggressive and elegant, with the various trim levels providing distinctly different flavors. the r-design, for instance, with its gloss-black grille, looks particularly sporty,

expert ratings come from hours of both driving and number crunching to make sure that you choose the best car for you. we comprehensively experience and analyze every new suv, car, truck, or minivan for sale in the u.s. and compare it to its competitors. when all that dust settles, we have our ratings.\\nwe require new ratings every time an all-new vehicle or a new generation of an existing vehicle comes out. additionally, we reassess those ratings when a new-generation vehicle receives a mid-cycle refresh \\u2014 basically, sprucing up a car in the middle of its product cycle (typically, around the 2-3 years mark) with a minor facelift, often with updates to features and technology.\\nrather than pulling random numbers out of the air or off some meaningless checklist,

powertrain, the ride and handling, the features, the comfort, and of course, about the price. does it serve the purpose for which it was built?

xc90, and one of the key design elements is a woodgrain ribbon spanning the width of the dash. the instruments are clear, and the panel features a driver-information center between the speedometer and tachometer. leather covers the steering wheel and gear lever on all models.\\nthe  center stack is dominated by a large touch screen, mounted in a vertical fashion, a la tesla. with its multiple menus and controls, this sensus system helps to de-clutter the interior and provide a welcome scandinavian ambience, but it does require  drivers to take their eyes off the road a bit too often. on a positive note, the  seats are all-day comfortable, even with the large side bolsters that provide excellent cornering support. a large cargo area with a flat floor is found behind the rear bench, which is suitable for three.\\nexterior stylingthe  also looks a lot like the xc90 on the outside, which is a good thing because the xc90 ranks high on our list of most attractive suvs. somehow, the

midsize luxury sedan makes its debut, along with the rest of a new 5 series generation. maximum range is a claimed 295 miles. pricing starts at $66,800.\\njust like the i7 is an all-electric version of the 7 series, the new  is a battery-powered 5 series. the entire 5 series undergoes a transformation for this model year, with updated construction and fresh tech features. and although  vehicles tend to be among the costliest in their respective classes, the built-in-germany  is priced competitively.\\nfactor in a decent (yet not class-leading) range, along with the kind of exciting driving experience for which  is renowned, and we reckon the new  already looks like an intriguing contender. there are two  variants initially, the edrive40 and the top m60.\\nthe gasoline-powered new  5 series lineup is reviewed separately.\\nwe\\u2019ve logged hundreds of hours driving and evaluating this generation of electric luxury cars, including the  .\\nwhat's new for 2024the  is an all-new, all-electric midsize luxury sedan. it\\u2019s the battery-powered version of the 5 series, a new generation of which also debuts for 2024. the  m60 is the most powerful version of the new 5 series so far.\\n2024   pricingthe 2024   has a starting sticker price of $67,795, with the range-topping  m60 kicking off at $85,095. but kelley blue book fair purchase pricing currently suggests paying $5,573 to $5,830 less than msrp, depending on trim and equipment. these prices are updated weekly.msrpkbb fair purchase price (nat'l average)edrive40$67,795$62,222m60$85,095$79,265the genesis electrified g80 kicks off in the low $80k range. the mercedes-eq eqe sedan begins in the mid-$70k range. an audi a6 e-tron is also in the works. a fully loaded  m60 will overlap in price with the tesla model s, lucid air, and porsche taycan, all starting in the high $80k territory.\\nbefore buying a new  electric midsize luxury sedan, check the kelley blue book fair purchase price to know what you should be paying.\\npower, ride and handlingthe new  edrive40 employs one electric motor, driving the rear wheels with 335 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. the sprint from standstill to 60 mph happens in just 5.7 seconds.\\nat the top of the new 5 series lineup stands the  m60, with two electric motors, all-wheel drive, plus a considerable 590 horsepower and 586 lb-ft of torque. the m60 hits 60 mph in 3.7 seconds, which is fabulously fast.\\nan adaptive suspension is also standard in the m60 (optional in the edrive40), for a wider spectrum of comfort and sport settings. not that we\\u2019ve ever had issues with any other generation of 5 series. these cars have been delivering an impressive blend of poise and pliancy for years. even the famed  50:50 weight distribution (for a great, balanced feel) makes it into the .\\nin addition, the  m60 has rear-wheel steering (which  calls integral active steering) helping the car track through fast corners in a spectacular manner. that said, this doesn\\u2019t feel exactly like the kind of m car we\\u2019ve grown to know and love. the steering turns the front wheels, but there\\u2019s no sensation of a real connection. the wheel also feels slightly too thick for our tastes. while we\\u2019re on this negative trail, the front sport seats didn\\u2019t feel that comfortable to us. but we\\u2019re prepared to give  the benefit of the doubt because they might prove to be supportive over a longer drive.\\noverall, though, the  is smooth, silent and fast. it also has some smart technology to help the driver, like keeping a safe distance to the vehicle in front even when adaptive cruise control isn\\u2019t activated. while in the driver\\u2019s seat, we felt the cooling system switch itself on automatically after a while. and all it takes is a voice command to perform various functions. we said, \\u201chey, , activate massaging for the driver\\u2019s seat\\u201d and it happened straight away. we looked for steering-wheel paddles to change levels of brake regeneration, but just found a boost paddle instead, so that was a different kind of fun.\\nclassy interiorveganza is not some promotion at whole foods, but the name of a vegan-friendly simulated (and perforated) leather used on the seats, door panels, and even the steering wheel. the real stuff is available as an option.\\nthe new  doesn\\u2019t have conventional air vents, either.  calls them seam vents and they\\u2019re extremely low-profile, in a line going across the dash. overall, the \\u2019s cabin has high-quality materials and a restrained design that adds to the classiness. it also offers typical  extras like glass controls (which may not be everyone\\u2019s idea of tasteful), a panoramic sky lounge roof, and powered shades for the rear windows.\\nsitting up front, we really like the cushioned areas right where we\\u2019d rest our elbows. and rear passenger space is absolutely fine for an adult male of average size.\\ntrunk space is 17.3 cubic feet, a little less than the 18.4 cubic feet in the combustion-powered 5 series (because of the \\u2019s battery), but generous nonetheless. the rear seats can also split and fold in 40/20/40 fashion.\\nevolved exterior has its distinct design language, which could be an acquired taste for some. but we think the looks of the new  and the 5 series in general aren\\u2019t so polarizing that they would be deal-breakers. considering how adventurous  has been with other vehicles, there\\u2019s something pleasantly conventional about this car \\u2014 like it\\u2019s an evolution of previous generations. there are 13 paint choices, including a couple of special frozen finishes. and one option to add a bit of glitz is an illuminated grille.\\nour favorite features and tech curved display\\nevery new  comes with this impressive one-piece unit housing both a digital instrument cluster and the infotainment touchscreen.\\nautomatic park assistant\\nthis standard self-parking feature works for both perpendicular and parallel spaces.\\ninteraction bar\\nspanning the width of the dashboard, this standard feature has touch-control functions for the front passenger as well as the ability to blend in with the cabin\\u2019s multicolored ambient lighting.\\nairconsole\\nthis is a video gaming platform offered for the first time, with 15 titles available. players use their phones as controllers. it\\u2019s one way of passing the time while the  recharges its battery.\\nbowers & wilkins surround-sound system\\noptional in the edrive40, standard in the m60, we\\u2019re big fans of b&w audio systems for their clarity and power.\\ndriving assistance professional package\\noptional in both 2024  variants, but we think it\\u2019s worth the investment. this bundle includes a new highway assistant for hands-free (but not eyes-free) driving, plus evasive steering assistance, active lane-changing assistance, side collision protection, and front cross-traffic warning.\\nbattery, range, and charging says the 2024  edrive40 has a range of 295 miles. that\\u2019s good, even if it\\u2019s not breaking any boundaries. likewise with the 256-mile range of the  m60. both cars beat the porsche taycan\\u2019s best (246 miles), while comparing well with the genesis electrified g80 (282 miles) and looking fairly respectable against the mercedes-eq eqe sedan (305 miles).\\nanother important aspect is how fast an electric car can charge. the metric here is taking the battery from 10% capacity to 80% using a dc fast charger.  says the  can perform this task in 30 minutes. a genesis electrified g80 can be eight minutes down the road when an  driver unhooks the charging cable. but this is still acceptable in the present state of electric vehicle (ev) technology.\\na high-voltage (400 volts) lithium-ion battery supplies the spark for the new . usable energy works out to 84.3 kilowatt-hours (kwh). the battery fits under the floor, so there\\u2019s the same amount of passenger space in every 5 series model, electric or not.\\n\\u2019s electric motors are designed so they don\\u2019t require rare elements like cobalt, that would usually go into magnets. so that\\u2019s another little detail that might work in the \\u2019s favor.\\n4-year/50,000-mile warranty\\n\\u2019s new-vehicle and powertrain warranties both last four years or 50,000 miles, whichever happens first. this is typical among european luxury cars. the lithium-ion battery is covered for eight years or 100,000 miles. there\\u2019s also roadside assistance for the first four years, with unlimited mileage.\\nsafety\\nstandard safety equipment includes forward collision mitigation with left turn warning, active blind spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane-keeping assistance.\\nwhat did you think of this review?mediocregoodgreatkbb vehicle review and rating methodologyour expert ratings come from hours of both driving and number

seem like about 55.\\nthe t8, with 400 (or 415) horsepower coming from its hybrid gas/electric powertrain, is in another performance league altogether, with a rear-mounted electric motor driving the

of the key design elements is a woodgrain ribbon spanning the width of the dash. the instruments are clear, and the panel features a driver-information center between the speedometer and tachometer. leather covers the steering wheel and gear lever on all models.\\nthe  center stack is dominated by a large touch screen, mounted in a vertical fashion, a la tesla. with its multiple menus and controls, this sensus system helps to de-clutter the interior and provide a welcome scandinavian ambience, but it does require  drivers to take their eyes off the road a bit too often. on a positive note, the  seats are all-day comfortable, even with the large side bolsters that provide excellent cornering support. a large cargo area with a flat floor is found behind the rear bench, which is suitable for three.\\nexterior stylingthe  also looks a lot like the xc90 on the outside, which is a good thing because the xc90 ranks high on our list of most attractive suvs. somehow, the  manages to simultaneously look aggressive and elegant, with the various trim levels providing distinctly different flavors. the r-design, for instance, with its gloss-black grille, looks particularly sporty,

main trims: momentum, r-design, inscription and polestar engineered. although the x60 momentum is the least expensive model, it\\u2019s well equipped with leather, a panoramic moonroof, a power

expert ratings come from hours of both driving and number crunching to make sure that you choose the best car for you. we comprehensively experience and analyze every new suv, car, truck, or minivan for sale in the u.s. and compare it to its competitors. when all that dust settles, we have our ratings.\\nwe require new ratings every time an all-new vehicle or a new generation of an existing vehicle comes out. additionally, we reassess those ratings when a new-generation vehicle receives a mid-cycle refresh \\u2014 basically, sprucing up a car in the middle of its product cycle (typically, around the 2-3 years mark) with a minor facelift, often with updates to features and technology.\\nrather than pulling random numbers out of the air or off some meaningless checklist,

offers a quad-motor variant starting at $87,000. the larger battery pack is $6,000, or the max pack (not available with the quad-motor model) is $16,000. taking the quad-motor and adding a bunch of options will push the final price a little past $100k.\\nthe electric pickup class is still in its infancy, but there are already some intriguing contenders. the ford f-150 lightning, for example, starts at $56k \\u2014 albeit quite a sparse model at that price. the new gmc hummer ev pickup starts at $109k. and the tesla cybertruck is supposed to be coming for 2023, but we shouldn\\u2019t hold

preferred radio station as well.\\nelectric motors generate exceptional torque and the  tackles uphill stretches as if they didn\\u2019t exist. a pair of them provides all-wheel drive, with the rear motor handling a larger share of the work in normal conditions, creating a sporty feel and maximizing efficiency.\\nin the xdrive 50, the sprint from standstill to 60 mph happens in a brief 4.6 seconds. naturally, the more powerful  m60 is quicker: 3.6 seconds.\\nthe  feels stable regardless of speed, and remains composed through corners, even though the suspension is tuned primarily for comfort. the  m60 also has an air suspension as standard, bringing smoothness as well as the kind of precise handling that comes with an m model.\\nthe brake pedal can feel a little too eager initially, but the overall action is acceptable and something the driver can get used to quite quickly.\\none facet that has a small learning curve is one-pedal driving. there are three levels of brake energy regeneration, so easing off the throttle slows the vehicle down more than it would in a conventional car with a combustion engine. in the stop/go mayhem of city traffic, this can be a distinct advantage. the right foot rarely has to jump over to the brake pedal and then back again.\\nwe\\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours driving and researching the current collection of luxury electric suvs.\\nsmart interiordespite the use of recycled materials \\u2014 like nylon waste and old fishing nets \\u2014 the cabin of the 2023  looks and feels as premium as anyone spending the best part of $100k on a vehicle would want.\\nthere\\u2019s a suitably high-tech atmosphere as well. the 12.3-inch driver information display is incorporated into a larger curved unit (covered with glare-resistant glass) that also accommodates a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen. this is complemented by a hexagonal steering wheel.\\nadult passengers in the back shouldn\\u2019t find much to complain about with 38.9 inches of legroom. behind the 40/20/40 split/folding rear seats is an expansive luggage area of 35.5 cubic feet. with those seats folded, cargo volume maxes out at 77.9 cubic feet.\\nsome electric cars have an extra storage space under the hood, but  doesn\\u2019t want customers rummaging around there. adding windshield wiper fluid is done by flipping up the  badge.\\nintelligent exteriorsize-wise, the 2023  is similar to the ever-popular x5. the closer we get to the , though, the more the differences stand out. we might as well talk about the grille first, since it\\u2019s hard to miss.\\nfirstly, an electric vehicle doesn\\u2019t really need a grille. but it\\u2019s a  hallmark, so it\\u2019s part of the  package, repurposed as an \\u201cintelligence panel\\u201d containing sensors for the driver assistance and advanced safety features. the rear  badge does something similar, housing the rearview camera. the door handles are flush to the body for optimum aerodynamics, and the headlights are much smaller than an x5\\u2019s.\\non the subject of aerodynamics, the  has an extremely low drag coefficient of 0.25. this also helps to keep wind noise low.\\nthe new  m60 has a roof made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (cfrp) to shave off a little weight and lower the center of gravity even more. and the brake calipers are painted that special shade of m blue.\\nour favorite features and techsustainability\\n\\u2019s ambition is to build electric vehicles cleaner and greener than the competition. this includes responsible sourcing of rare elements like cobalt and lithium for the batteries, fitting recycled materials into the cabins, using solar power to make aluminum components, and hydro-electric power for specialized manufacturing plants.\\ninfotainment system\\nmost people familiar with \\u2019s infotainment system know that it\\u2019s called idrive. now in its eighth iteration, it has evolved to become wonderfully user-friendly and able to incorporate the specific needs of electric vehicles. in the new  , it comes with a curved 14.9-inch touchscreen, over-the-air updates, advanced voice recognition, and dedicated user profiles.\\nrapid charging\\nbeing able to add 90 miles of range in 10 minutes (using a dc fast charger) is impressive. just answer a couple of emails and it\\u2019s time to hit the road again.\\nhead-up display with augmented reality\\noptional in the xdrive50, standard in the m60, this head-up display uses augmented reality to superimpose things like arrows onto the road, making navigation information clearer.\\nadaptive led headlights with laserlight\\nadaptive headlights follow the direction of the steering. they can also change the shape of the illumination area, so as not to dazzle other road users. the laser tech is more powerful than leds, yet require even less energy \\u2014 an important consideration for an electric vehicle. these are standard in the m60.\\nbowers & wilkins surround-sound system\\nexclusive to the m60, this 30-speaker/1,615-watt arrangement is an absolute treat for the ears.\\nbattery power, charge times, and rangein the regular 2023  xdrive50, 516 horsepower and 564 lb-ft of torque is developed by twin electric motors. they\\u2019re constructed in such a way that no rare earth metals are required for any

mighty 811 lb-ft of torque, achieving maximum output in sport mode and with launch control engaged. most of the time, a still-impressive 532 horsepower and 749 lb-ft of torque are simmering away under

miles of range can be transmitted in 10 minutes.\\nrecharging from a domestic outlet takes considerably longer. an 11-kilowatt home setup achieves a full charge in 10.25 hours.\\nthese energy consumption figures from the environmental protection agency (epa) might seem a little odd at first, since larger wheels usually mean shorter ranges. but the differences between all-weather tires and

wanting a car that could corner, accelerate, and brake like a sports car but needed the convenience of four doors had to turn to a car like the  3 series. crossover suvs have challenged that notion, and the   is arguably one of the best examples. even with its added ground clearance, the  is among the sportiest of sport utility vehicles.\\neven in base form, the  offers plenty of horsepower for quick acceleration. the \\u2019s inherent rear-wheel-drive layout and well-sorted suspension allow it to round corners like a low-slung sedan while simultaneously offering enough ground clearance for light off-roading. the rear-wheel-drive  sdrive30i and all-wheel-drive xdrive30i can dash to 60 mph in 6 seconds \\u2014 pretty quick for a small suv. move up to the 6-cylinder  m40i, and that time drops to 4.4 seconds. the high-performance (and high-priced)  m can hit that benchmark in as little as 4 seconds. that\\u2019s just a tick behind the other little monsters in this class, the v8-powered mercedes-amg glc and alfa romeo stelvio quadrifoglio.\\nas we noted, the  has a rear-wheel-drive (rwd) bias, whereas most of its rivals are front-wheel-drive or front-biased. the \\u2019s rwd setup allows the front wheels to focus on steering as opposed to also powering the vehicle, which, as every driving enthusiast knows, is the preferred setup when speeding through tight turns. a smooth-shifting 8-speed automatic includes paddle shifters for manual gear changes, while \\u2019s driving dynamics control allows the driver to tailor vehicle settings to his or her likings.\\nduring our time with the system, we found the sport+ mode made the steering too heavy. by playing with the customizable settings, we were able to tone down the steering feel while boosting settings for the engine and throttle response, in essence creating our own unique .\\ninterior comfort\\u2019s  has the same design aesthetic as other recent vehicles from the german luxury brand. there\\u2019s a wide-view display mounted high on the dash, the idrive control knob alongside \\u2019s unique gear selector, and the same ergonomics of the  ownership experience for the past couple of decades. it leans more toward the minimalistic end, but there\\u2019s a built-in premium feel to its simplicity. controls for common functions like audio and climate are logical and easy to reach, but the idrive circular controller for screen functions and even the pistol-like gearshift take some getting used to. we recommend getting familiar with both during your test drive.\\ninterior tech includes a standard 8.8-inch touchscreen or optional 10.25-inch display. one really nice touch is the optional all-digital instrument panel that replaces the analog gauges with a fully configurable 12.3-inch screen, similar to audi\\u2019s virtual cockpit.\\nas we highlighted in favorite features, the  is roomy inside, even for its compact class. the driver and front passenger have plenty of space, and most rear-seat passengers will find good legroom. headroom is similarly plentiful, and the cargo space is near the top of the class in both usability and outright space. in addition to a flat-floor cargo area, there\\u2019s room for small items should you want to hide them beneath the floor. the new  plug-in hybrid xdrive30e doesn\\u2019t sacrifice much space even with its battery pack under the rear seats. it has only 1.5 cubic feet less space than the standard model.\\nexterior stylingif it seems even small cars today are bigger, it\\u2019s not your imagination. this latest, third-generation  is actually slightly larger than the first-generation  x5, which is technically a size bigger. but the  wears its volume well and doesn\\u2019t look oversized. the optional 20- or 21-inch wheels look great, and the wide stance imparts a sense of stability.\\nwe think the overall integration of headlights, grille, and other elements feels more cohesive on this model than that of the previous generation. the same is true in the back, where the taillights flow cleanly into the tailgate. the  m40i wears more aggressive sheet metal, with deeper front and rear bumpers, body-color side-sill extensions, and more aggressive wheel-and-tire combinations. the  m sits lower to the ground, rolls on 21-inch wheels and tires, and boasts quad exhaust outlets.\\nfavorite featuresandroid auto integration\\nthis is more a \\u201cfinally!\\u201d than a \\u201cfavorite,\\u201d but it\\u2019s worth highlighting nonetheless. while s have long integrated apple carplay, that hasn\\u2019t been the case with rival android smartphones. that changes with the 2021 model year, with s finally getting android auto, too.\\nspace management\\nlittle on the outside doesn\\u2019t always mean little on the inside, too. the  provides good legroom both front and rear, and even better headroom stats. the \\u2019s cargo hold measures 28.7 cubic feet, which is more than the audi q5 but less than the infiniti qx50. a triple-split/folding rear seat allows 2-passenger seating while the center section can be folded to accommodate long items like skis or 2x4s.\\nstandard featuresthe 2021   comes in five main forms: sdrive30i, xdrive30i, m40i, xdrive30e, and the high-performance  m.\\nout the gate, the 2021   sdrive30i comes nicely equipped with a power tailgate, 3-zone automatic climate control, 10-way-power front seats, sensatec faux-leather upholstery, rain-sensing windshield wipers, universal garage-door opener, and standard parking sensors.\\nthe standard idrive infotainment system bundles an 8.8-inch screen that can be controlled by touch or the idrive dial, navigation, and a 12-speaker/205-watt am/fm/hd radio with usb input and bluetooth streaming. apple carplay and android auto are standard. for 2021, siriusxm satellite radio with a one-year trial is included.\\nstandard active safety features include frontal-collision warning and the automatic city collision mitigation braking system, which can automatically apply the brakes if the vehicle senses an impending crash. now standard for 2021 is the formerly optional active driving assistant package with lane-departure warning, pedestrian detection, and blind-spot monitoring.\\nnew s also include ultimate care, which covers three years/36,000 miles of complimentary maintenance.\\nfactory optionsthe  xdrive30i adds all-wheel drive ( calls it \\u201cxdrive\\u201d), and like the sdrive30i model offers three jumping-off points: xline, luxury and m sport. the luxury line, for example, adds chrome trim, while the m sport gives the standard model sporty-looking flair.\\nwhile there are plenty of stand-alone options,  has grouped many of them into \\u201ctiers.\\u201d the convenience tier adds amenities like lumbar support, keyless entry, and a panoramic sunroof. premium adds the sweet 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a head-up display, heated front/rear seats, and heated steering wheel. the executive tier includes adaptive full led headlights, parking assistant, surround view with 3d view, and \\u2019s rather finicky gesture control.\\nbesides a more powerful engine and other performance gear, the m40i takes a different approach, offering many of those features as stand-alone option packages. note that both models offer leather as an option, not standard. other options include the driver assistance plus package that bundles adaptive cruise control, active lane-keeping assist, and other active-safety features, while the dynamic handling package features dynamic damper control, m sport brake and variable sport steering. also in the offering are a premium harman/kardon audio system, wireless phone charger, and wi-fi hotspot.\\nthe high-performance  m includes a 473-horsepower turbocharged 6-cylinder engine and upgraded hardware to back up its extra power. that includes performance brakes, differential, and transmission. the  m rolls on standard 20-inch wheels with performance tires and includes upgraded amenities like leather interior, harman kardon audio system, and a hands-free liftgate. even this model can be spruced up. the $7,000 competition package adds 30 horsepower, 21-inch wheels, blacked-out aesthetics, sport exhaust, and more.\\nengine & transmissionyou get a choice of four powertrains in the 2021   lineup. at the entry-level, the sdrive30i and all-wheel-drive xdrive30i are powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder developing 248 horsepower. this engine exists throughout the  lineup and has proven itself as reliable as it is fuel-efficient.\\nmoving up to the  m40i brings two more cylinders in the turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6, as well as standard xdrive all-wheel drive. with 355 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, this engine never feels taxed or labored, even with four persons aboard. fuel economy does go down by a few mpg, but is still acceptable for an engine of this size and output.\\nthe xdrive30e is the first plug-in hybrid version of the . it pairs a turbocharged 2.0-liter and battery-fed electric motor to produce a total of 288 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque.  says the xdrive30e does 0-60 mph in 5.9 seconds. moreover, it\\u2019s also very efficient, earning up to 60 miles per gallon equivalent (mpge). the xdrive30e can travel up to 18 miles on electricity alone. in hybrid mode, it goes up to 68 mph on electric power alone, and up to 84 mph in electric mode. on a level 2 charger, the plug-in  can be recharged in approximately 3 hours.\\nfor the power-hungry, the  m uses a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 to make a ridiculous 473 horsepower or 503 horsepower in the  m competition.\\nall models have an 8-speed automatic transmission. also onboard is the fuel-saving start/stop system that can be somewhat annoying as it\\u2019s far from seamless. the system can be deactivated, but the driver must do so every time the car is started, as with most other systems of this type.\\n2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4\\n248 horsepower @ 5,200-6,500 rpm\\n258 lb-ft of torque @ 1,450-4,800 rpm\\nepa city/highway fuel economy: 25/29 mpg (rwd), 23/29 mpg (awd)\\n3.0-liter

review?mediocregoodgreatkbb vehicle review and rating methodologyour expert ratings come from hours of both driving and number crunching to make sure that you choose the best car for you. we comprehensively experience and analyze every new suv, car, truck, or minivan for sale in the u.s. and compare it to its competitors. when all that dust settles, we have our ratings.\\nwe require new ratings every time an all-new vehicle or a new generation of an existing vehicle comes out. additionally, we reassess those ratings when a new-generation vehicle receives a mid-cycle refresh \\u2014 basically, sprucing up a car in the middle of its product cycle (typically, around the 2-3 years mark) with a minor facelift, often with updates to features and technology.\\nrather than pulling random numbers out of the air or off some meaningless checklist, kbb\\u2019s editors rank a vehicle to where it belongs in its class. before any car earns its kbb rating, it must prove itself to be

$84,100.\\nthe   is now officially a range. last year, the lineup was just one model, the xdrive50. this year sees the addition of the 2023  m60.\\nthis is significant. for  to make an m version of what is still a new vehicle without an established track record (so to speak; the  debuted only last year) shows the company\\u2019s commitment to electric vehicles while retaining the talents for which  cars \\u2014 especially versions from the high-performance m division \\u2014 are quite rightly praised.\\nanother aspect of all this is how battery technology is now at the level where it can be a convincing method of propulsion for luxury cars and sporty cars alike. ranges are great enough to dispel anxiety, charging times are quick enough to be practical. the lithium-ion battery in the  has an 8-year/100,000-mile warranty.\\nspeaking of lithium, and cobalt, aluminum, carbon fiber reinforced plastic, and all the other particular elements that go into making a modern electric vehicle,

as well.\\nelectric motors generate exceptional torque and the  tackles uphill stretches as if they didn\\u2019t exist. a pair of them provides all-wheel drive, with the rear motor handling a larger share of the work in normal conditions, creating a sporty feel and maximizing efficiency.\\nin the xdrive 50, the sprint from standstill to 60 mph happens in a brief 4.6 seconds. naturally, the more powerful  m60 is quicker: 3.6 seconds.\\nthe  feels stable regardless of speed, and remains composed through corners, even though the suspension is tuned primarily for comfort. the  m60 also has an air suspension as standard, bringing smoothness as well as the kind of precise handling that comes with an m model.\\nthe brake pedal can feel a little too eager initially, but the overall action is acceptable and something the driver can get used to quite quickly.\\none facet that has a small learning curve is one-pedal driving. there are three levels of brake energy regeneration, so easing off the throttle slows the vehicle down more than it would in a conventional car with a combustion engine. in the stop/go mayhem of city traffic, this can be a distinct advantage. the right foot rarely has to jump over to the brake pedal and then back again.\\nwe\\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours driving and researching the current collection of luxury electric suvs.\\nsmart interiordespite the use of recycled materials \\u2014 like nylon waste and old fishing nets \\u2014 the cabin of the 2023  looks and feels as premium as anyone spending the best part of $100k on a vehicle would want.\\nthere\\u2019s a suitably high-tech atmosphere as well. the 12.3-inch driver information display is incorporated into a larger curved unit (covered with glare-resistant glass) that also accommodates a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen. this is complemented by a hexagonal steering wheel.\\nadult passengers in the back shouldn\\u2019t find much to complain about with 38.9 inches of legroom. behind the 40/20/40 split/folding rear seats is an expansive luggage area of 35.5 cubic feet. with those seats folded, cargo volume maxes out at 77.9 cubic feet.\\nsome electric cars have an extra storage space under the hood, but  doesn\\u2019t want customers rummaging around there. adding windshield wiper fluid is done by flipping up the  badge.\\nintelligent exteriorsize-wise, the 2023  is similar to the ever-popular x5. the closer we get to the , though, the more the differences stand out. we might as well talk about the grille first, since it\\u2019s hard to miss.\\nfirstly, an electric vehicle doesn\\u2019t really need a grille. but it\\u2019s a  hallmark, so it\\u2019s part of the  package, repurposed as an \\u201cintelligence panel\\u201d containing sensors for the driver assistance and advanced safety features. the rear  badge does something similar, housing the rearview camera. the door handles are flush to the body for optimum aerodynamics, and the headlights are much smaller than an x5\\u2019s.\\non the subject of aerodynamics, the  has an extremely low drag coefficient of 0.25. this also helps to keep wind noise low.\\nthe new  m60 has a roof made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (cfrp) to shave off a little weight and lower the center of gravity even more. and the brake calipers are painted that special shade of m blue.\\nour favorite features and techsustainability\\n\\u2019s ambition is to build electric vehicles cleaner and greener than the competition. this includes responsible sourcing of rare elements like cobalt and lithium for the batteries, fitting recycled materials into the cabins, using solar power to make aluminum components, and hydro-electric power for specialized manufacturing plants.\\ninfotainment system\\nmost people familiar with \\u2019s infotainment system know that it\\u2019s called idrive. now in its eighth iteration, it has evolved to become wonderfully user-friendly and able to incorporate the specific needs of electric vehicles. in the new  , it comes with a curved 14.9-inch touchscreen, over-the-air updates, advanced voice recognition, and dedicated user profiles.\\nrapid charging\\nbeing able to add 90 miles of range in 10 minutes (using a dc fast charger) is impressive. just answer a couple of emails and it\\u2019s time to hit the road again.\\nhead-up display with augmented reality\\noptional in the xdrive50, standard in the m60, this head-up display uses augmented reality to superimpose things like arrows onto the road, making navigation information clearer.\\nadaptive led headlights with laserlight\\nadaptive headlights follow the direction of the steering. they can also change the shape of the illumination area, so as not to dazzle other road users. the laser tech is more powerful than leds, yet require even less energy \\u2014 an important consideration for an electric vehicle. these are standard in the m60.\\nbowers & wilkins surround-sound system\\nexclusive to the m60, this 30-speaker/1,615-watt arrangement is an absolute treat for the ears.\\nbattery power, charge times, and rangein the regular 2023  xdrive50, 516 horsepower and 564 lb-ft of torque is developed by twin electric motors. they\\u2019re constructed in such a way that no rare earth metals are required for any magnetic components.\\nwith one motor driving each axle, the  xdrive50 and the  m60 have an electronic version of all-wheel drive as standard.\\nthe new-for-2023  m60 develops 610 horsepower and a mighty 811 lb-ft of torque, achieving maximum output in sport mode and with launch control engaged. most of the time, a still-impressive 532 horsepower and 749 lb-ft of torque are simmering away under the hood.\\nboth vehicles have liquid-cooled lithium-ion batteries mounted under the floor. using a dc fast charger, replenishment from a 10% capacity to 80% can take as little as 35 minutes. or 90 miles of range can be transmitted in 10 minutes.\\nrecharging from a domestic outlet takes considerably longer. an 11-kilowatt home setup achieves a full charge in 10.25 hours.\\nthese energy consumption figures from the environmental protection agency (epa) might seem a little odd at first, since larger wheels usually mean shorter ranges. but the differences between all-weather tires and performance tires throw an extra factor into the calculations.\\n2023   xdrive50\\n516

new?\n","high-performance  m60\n","new options packages\n","gesture control revised\n","made in an eco-friendly factory, the 2023   all-electric luxury midsize suv can be a great choice for those whose plentiful finances are equaled by the desire for responsible personal transport. pricing starts at $84,100.\n","the   is now officially a range. last year, the lineup was just one model, the xdrive50. this year sees the addition of the 2023  m60.\n","this is significant. for  to make an m version of what is still a new vehicle without an established track record (so to speak; the  debuted only last year) shows the company’s commitment to electric vehicles while retaining the talents for which  cars — especially versions from the high-performance m division — are quite rightly praised.\n","another aspect of all this is how battery technology is now at the level where it can be a convincing method of propulsion for luxury cars and sporty cars alike. ranges are great enough to dispel anxiety, charging times are quick enough to be practical. the lithium-ion battery in the  has an 8-year/100,000-mile warranty.\n","speaking of lithium, and cobalt, aluminum, carbon fiber reinforced plastic, and all the other particular elements that go into making a modern electric vehicle,  is taking steps to ensure they are all sourced responsibly and sustainably — with transparency and respecting human rights.\n","2023   pricingthe 2023   has a starting sticker price of $85,095, with the range-topping  m60 kicking off at $109,895. but kelley blue book fair purchase pricing currently suggests paying $7,472 to $10,605 less than msrp, depending on trim and equipment. these prices are updated weekly.msrpkbb fair purchase price (nat'l average)xdrive50$85,095$77,623m60$109,895$99,290driving the 2023  smartphone recognition means never having to dig around in pockets or purses for the car keys to open and start the 2023 . for all the technology that comes in the , it’s still user-friendly. it will automatically select each driver’s preferred radio station as well.\n","electric motors generate exceptional torque and the  tackles uphill stretches as if they didn’t exist. a pair of them provides all-wheel drive, with the rear motor handling a larger share of the work in normal conditions, creating a sporty feel and maximizing efficiency.\n","in the xdrive 50, the sprint from standstill to 60 mph happens in a brief 4.6 seconds. naturally, the more powerful  m60 is quicker: 3.6 seconds.\n","the  feels stable regardless of speed, and remains composed through corners, even though the suspension is tuned primarily for comfort. the  m60 also has an air suspension as standard, bringing smoothness as well as the kind of precise handling that comes with an m model.\n","the brake pedal can feel a little too eager initially, but the overall action is acceptable and something the driver can get used to quite quickly.\n","one facet that has a small learning curve is one-pedal driving. there are three levels of brake energy regeneration, so easing off the throttle slows the vehicle down more than it would in a conventional car with a combustion engine. in the stop/go mayhem of city traffic, this can be a distinct advantage. the right foot rarely has to jump over to the brake pedal and then back again.\n","we’ve spent hundreds of hours driving and researching the current collection of luxury electric suvs.\n","smart interiordespite the use of recycled materials — like nylon waste and old fishing nets — the cabin of the 2023  looks and feels as premium as anyone spending the best part of $100k on a vehicle would want.\n","there’s a suitably high-tech atmosphere as well. the 12.3-inch driver information display is incorporated into a larger curved unit (covered with glare-resistant glass) that also accommodates a 14.9-inch infotainment touchscreen. this is complemented by a hexagonal steering wheel.\n","adult passengers in the back shouldn’t find much to complain about with 38.9 inches of legroom. behind the 40/20/40 split/folding rear seats is an expansive luggage area of 35.5 cubic feet. with those seats folded, cargo volume maxes out at 77.9 cubic feet.\n","some electric cars have an extra storage space under the hood, but  doesn’t want customers rummaging around there. adding windshield wiper fluid is done by flipping up the  badge.\n","intelligent exteriorsize-wise, the 2023  is similar to the ever-popular x5. the closer we get to the , though, the more the differences stand out. we might as well talk about the grille first, since it’s hard to miss.\n","firstly, an electric vehicle doesn’t really need a grille. but it’s a  hallmark, so it’s part of the  package, repurposed as an “intelligence panel” containing sensors for the driver assistance and advanced safety features. the rear  badge does something similar, housing the rearview camera. the door handles are flush to the body for optimum aerodynamics, and the headlights are much smaller than an x5’s.\n","on the subject of aerodynamics, the  has an extremely low drag coefficient of 0.25. this also helps to keep wind noise low.\n","the new  m60 has a roof made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (cfrp) to shave off a little weight and lower the center of gravity even more. and the brake calipers are painted that special shade of m blue.\n","our favorite features and techsustainability\n","’s ambition is to build electric vehicles cleaner and greener than the competition. this includes responsible sourcing of rare elements like cobalt and lithium for the batteries, fitting recycled materials into the cabins, using solar power to make aluminum components, and hydro-electric power for specialized manufacturing plants.\n","infotainment system\n","most people familiar with ’s infotainment system know that it’s called idrive. now in its eighth iteration, it has evolved to become wonderfully user-friendly and able to incorporate the specific needs of electric vehicles. in the new  , it comes with a curved 14.9-inch touchscreen, over-the-air updates, advanced voice recognition, and dedicated user profiles.\n","rapid charging\n","being able to add 90 miles of range in 10 minutes (using a dc fast charger) is impressive. just answer a couple of emails and it’s time to hit the road again.\n","head-up display with augmented reality\n","optional in the xdrive50, standard in the m60, this head-up display uses augmented reality to superimpose things like arrows onto the road, making navigation information clearer.\n","adaptive led headlights with laserlight\n","adaptive headlights follow the direction of the steering. they can also change the shape of the illumination area, so as not to dazzle other road users. the laser tech is more powerful than leds, yet require even less energy — an important consideration for an electric vehicle. these are standard in the m60.\n","bowers & wilkins surround-sound system\n","exclusive to the m60, this 30-speaker/1,615-watt arrangement is an absolute treat for the ears.\n","battery power, charge times, and rangein the regular 2023  xdrive50, 516 horsepower and 564 lb-ft of torque is developed by twin electric motors. they’re constructed in such a way that no rare earth metals are required for any magnetic components.\n","with one motor driving each axle, the  xdrive50 and the  m60 have an electronic version of all-wheel drive as standard.\n","the new-for-2023  m60 develops 610 horsepower and a mighty 811 lb-ft of torque, achieving maximum output in sport mode and with launch control engaged. most of the time, a still-impressive 532 horsepower and 749 lb-ft of torque are simmering away under the hood.\n","both vehicles have liquid-cooled lithium-ion batteries mounted under the floor. using a dc fast charger, replenishment from a 10% capacity to 80% can take as little as 35 minutes. or 90 miles of range can be transmitted in 10 minutes.\n","recharging from a domestic outlet takes considerably longer. an 11-kilowatt home setup achieves a full charge in 10.25 hours.\n","these energy consumption figures from the environmental protection agency (epa) might seem a little odd at first, since larger wheels usually mean shorter ranges. but the differences between all-weather tires and performance tires throw an extra factor into the calculations.\n","2023   xdrive50\n","516 horsepower total output\n","564 lb-ft of torque\n","epa city/highway fuel economy: 86/87 mpge (20-inch
